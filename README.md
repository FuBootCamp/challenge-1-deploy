## Description of the project
In this second installment of challenge 1 where I am correcting the bar menu links to the different sections of the page, I take the opportunity to update the version of the readme file.
Refactoring the code to generate a cleaner one seemed to me a great guideline to maintain throughout the bootcamp.
This challenge represented for me my first time in front of both javascript and CSS code.Understanding how the layout of a page is made, the sections and how the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file is given.
To understand how the different commands work to place headers, the menu bar, the images and the "href" command to jump to a specific section of the page using an ID (identifier).
